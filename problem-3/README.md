# Problem 3

You will build a web application for querying user information from the Github
API that looks like the following:

Notes:
- Use only native APIs, Javascript, HTML and CSS (no external libraries permitted.
- You may use whatever style of async programming primitives you like such as callbacks, promises or streams.
- The API endpoint for retrieving user information is https://api.github.com/users.
- The user of your application can input a username and search in Github for that user’s information. 
- The information should be displayed as shown, including the avatar picture at the top left.
- The repo information can be obtained by following the “repos_url”. 
   You should implement a scrollable list to display these if the number exceeds 5.
- Marks will be awarded for code quality such as formatting and how DRY your code is.
